# Add absolute timestamps to GitHub Issue comments
- Gives you absolute timestamps for comments in GitHub via a UserScript manager.

- Only applies to issue comments because I can't figure out how to fix the timestamp strings from overlapping other elements on other pages due to them being longer than GitHub is expecting. If you want to fix it, please feel free to submit a PR!  

- The absolute dates only version may not work completely as I don't use it.

Replace ```1 Day Ago``` with ```Yesterday``` if you want it to say ```Yesterday``` instead.
